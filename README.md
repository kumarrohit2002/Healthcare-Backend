# üìù Healthcare Backend 
## Project Description

The **Healthcare API** is a backend system built using **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** with **JWT Authentication**. It provides a structured and secure way to manage healthcare data, including **users, patients, doctors, and their relationships (mappings)**.

This project simulates a **basic healthcare management system**, where:

* Users can **register and authenticate** using JWT.
* Admins or authenticated users can **create and manage patient and doctor records**.
* Patients can be **assigned to doctors** through a mapping system, making it possible to track which doctor is responsible for which patient.

The API is fully **REST-compliant**, supporting **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for patients and doctors, and also includes endpoints for **assigning, retrieving, and removing patient-doctor relationships**.

It is designed as a **learning and demonstration project** to showcase:
‚úÖ User authentication with JWT
‚úÖ REST API development with DRF
‚úÖ Database modeling for healthcare use-cases
‚úÖ CRUD operations for patients & doctors
‚úÖ Many-to-many relationship handling with mappings
‚úÖ Secure API endpoints with permissions
‚úÖ Admin panel support for data management

This backend system can serve as the **foundation for a larger healthcare application**, such as:

* A **patient-doctor appointment booking system**
* A **medical record management platform**
* A **hospital or clinic management system**

# üè• Healthcare API (Django + DRF + JWT)

A simple **Healthcare Management Backend** built with **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** and **JWT Authentication**.  
It supports managing **Users, Patients, Doctors, and Patient-Doctor Mappings**.

## üöÄ Features
- ‚úÖ User registration & JWT login
- ‚úÖ Patient management (CRUD)
- ‚úÖ Doctor management (CRUD)
- ‚úÖ Patient ‚Üî Doctor mapping (assign, retrieve, delete)
- ‚úÖ JWT-protected APIs
- ‚úÖ Admin panel support
````

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd healthcare

2. **Create virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


4. **Create `.env` file** in the root folder and add:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=healthcare_secret
   DEBUG=True
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost

   DB_NAME=healthcare_db
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=postgres
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   ```

5. **Apply migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create superuser (admin)**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

API will be available at:
üëâ `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## üîê Authentication

This project uses **JWT Authentication**.

* **Obtain token**

  ```http
  POST /api/token/
  ```

  **Request:**

  ```json
  {
    "username": "rohit",
    "password": "mypassword"
  }
  ```

  **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
    "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
  }
  ```

* **Use the token in headers**

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  ```
